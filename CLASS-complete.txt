01 Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
02 the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

03 Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an
04 utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life
05 forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches
06 are a pretty neat idea.

07 This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
08 of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many
09 solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were
10 largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper,
11 which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of
12 paper that were unhappy.

13 And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and
14 most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.

15 Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big
16 mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some
17 said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should
18 ever have left the oceans.

19 And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man
20 had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice
21 to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in
22 Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going
23 wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be
24 made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work,
25 and no one would have to get nailed to anything.

26 Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone
27 about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost
28 forever.

29 This is not her story.

30 But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe
31 and some of its consequences.

32 It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide
33 to the Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until
34 the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any
35 Earthman.
